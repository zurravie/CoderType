# CoderType

This is a silly typing game I made as an experiment to see
how much can chatGPT help me in coding.

Run locally using: `yarn parcel index.html`

The code for the game itself is licensed under MIT. But the code snippets used in `scripts/data` are licensed as the corresponding open source repositories they are taken from.
